# User-story

As the municipality i want to be able to see the temperature in our different locals in real-time. I want it to be easy to read the information and to switch between different locals. I don't want to switch battery too often due to our premises is spread over a large area and would be very time consuming to change battery once a week. Due to this the requirement of battery life was set to be at least a quarter. The product should be standalone and be driven by a 9 volt battery. I want to be able to see the values from the last 7 days and 24 hours and easily comprehend the information. Due to this i want the values to be displayed in two graphs. The values should be stored in a database and then sent to a website which can be accessed from anywhere with a connection. The database should be written in mySQL with the website being written in React. The hardware should be a raspberry pi pico w so it can connect it to the wifi. The code running on the pico should be written in micropython. I as the municipality also want to be able to see the values for sound volume and carbon dioxide content. Hence i want the product to be prepared for more sensors and more values to be presented.
